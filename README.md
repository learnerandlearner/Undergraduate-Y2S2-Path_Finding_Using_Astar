# Undergraduate-Y2S2-Path_Finding_Using_Astar
A* Search pathfinding will be performed to find the targets from the starting  point in a given environment. 2 different A* Search for each map using 2 different heuristic functions, which is  Euclidean Distance Heuristic and Manhattan Distance Heuristic will be performed respectively.

In this project, A* Search pathfinding will be performed to find the targets from the starting 
point in a given environment. There will be 4 different maps being performed, 2 of the 
maps consist of 1 target, and another 2 maps consist of 2 and 3 targets respectively. Besides, I will 
perform 2 different A* Search for each map using 2 different heuristic functions, which is 
Euclidean Distance Heuristic and Manhattan Distance Heuristic respectively. Then, a comparison 
between both heuristics will be made and analysed.
